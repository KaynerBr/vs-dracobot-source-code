:dad:The stereo should be connected now...
:dad:Oh! Hey guys! Over here! You're just in time!
w:dad:I'm so happy you made it here! It's been 3 years since I last saw you, Broki!

:gf:Yeah! It's nice to meet you.
:dad:The pleasure is all mine!
:gf:Anyways, the elevators weren't working and we had to take the stairs...
:gf:Well, I had to go to my demon form and fly us to the top floor since BF was getting a bit tired. It was a lot of stairs...
:dad:Yeah... Forgot to mention that the elevators have been acting wonky recently. Sorry about that.
:gf:No need to apologize.
:bf:Bep Bo Bap.
:gf:Though, mind if I ask something about you?
:dad:Oh!
:dad:If I remember correctly, some information about me should be found within the assets folder.
:dad:Some of them is actual information while others is just for shits and giggles.
:gf:I see...
:bf:Beep bo bap.
:gf:...Hey? Why is there an outline there?
:dad:Oh. I don't know honestly. It's been there longer than I can remember.
:gf:What about the pair of shoes with a note on it?
:dad:I don't know about that either. Sorry...
:gf:Ah...
:dad:Anyways, let's get started, shall we?
:bf:Ske-be!
